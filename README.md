# Core Platform Coding Challenge


## Background

[Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/) is a project originally created within the Core Platform team. We have been utilising the flexibility Benthos gives us to read data from many possible places and an array of available processors. Crucially, benthos has the ability to extend its inputs, outputs and processors with custom plugins.

Within our pipelines we look to enrich documents with additional data that we call “enrichments”. In most cases, these enrichments use features available in Benthos, but some others need to have custom plugins that are internal to us and not open-sourced.


## Challenge

The challenge we will be asking you to take on is to create a plugin for a processor to do a specific task, which we will reveal on the day of the interview. So that you aren’t spending hours setting up your dev environment we have created a public git repo with everything you’d need to get going. This way you can focus solely on the implementation of the processor.


## Preparation

To minimise the amount of time needed to get up and running with the coding challenge we have some useful links and access to the git repo so that you can try and get the service up and running in its skeleton form.

*   Benthos website: [https://www.benthos.dev/](https://www.benthos.dev/)
*   Benthos documentation: [https://docs.benthos.dev/](https://docs.benthos.dev/)
*   Write a Benthos Plugin blog post: [http://www.jeffail.uk/post/write-a-benthos-plugin/](http://www.jeffail.uk/post/write-a-benthos-plugin/)
*   Write a Benthos Plugin video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilah_Y0uMk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilah_Y0uMk4)
*   Benthos plugin examples repo: [https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos-plugin-example](https://github.com/benthosdev/benthos-plugin-example)

This is the actual git repo you will be working from. During the challenge, you will be asked to fork this repo in order to create a Pull Request that we will review together with a couple of members of the team.
